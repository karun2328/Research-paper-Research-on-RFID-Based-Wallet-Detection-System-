### Operating Modes

The Smart Wallet has two distinct operating modes: Normal mode and Lost mode.

### Alarm and Alert System

In Normal mode, if you unknowingly move a certain distance away from your wallet, the smart wallet triggers an alarm or sends an alert message to your smartphone. This immediate notification prevents you from leaving your wallet behind and enables you to quickly retrieve it.
